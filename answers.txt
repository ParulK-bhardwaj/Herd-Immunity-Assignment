What were the inputs you gave the simulation? 
(virus, pop_size, vacc_percentage, initial_infected)
virus_name = "Ebola"
repro_rate = 0.70
mortality_rate = 0.25
pop_size = 100000
vacc_percentage = 0.90
initial_infected = 10

What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?
9.1%

What percentage of the population died from the virus?
6.4%

Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many times, in total, did a vaccination save someone from potentially becoming infected?
865551
